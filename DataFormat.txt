Data Format
===========

The format of training and testing data file is:

<label>\t<index1>:<value1> <index2>:<value2> â€¦\n
.
.
.

Each line contains an instance and is ended by a '\n' character.

<label> is an indicator indicating the class id. Usually the indicator is an integer 
or a character. 
Integer:
The range of class id should be from 0 to the size of classes subtracting one. 
For example, the class id is 0, 1, 2 or 3 for a 4-class classification problem.
Character:
The class id should be a single character. For example, the class id can be 'B',
'M', 'E', 'S'.
 
<label> and <index>:<value> are sperated by a '\t' character. But <index>:<value> and 
<index>:<value> are sperated by a ' ' character. <index> is a postiveinteger denoting 
the feature id. The range of feature id should be from 1 to the size of feature set. 
For example, the feature id is 1, 2, ... 9 or 10 if the dimension of feature set is 10. 
<value> is a float denoting the value of feature.

If the feature value equals 0, the <index>:<value> is encourged to be neglected
for the consideration of storage space and computational speed.

Labels in the testing file are only used to calculate accuracy or errors. 
If they are unknown, just fill the first column with any class labels.
